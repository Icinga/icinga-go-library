# Icinga Go Library

The Icinga Go Library is a collection of Go packages used for common tasks in Icinga's Go applications.

While some of these packages are intended for internal use, others might be useful for extending Icinga applications.
For example, the `notifications` package is designed for interoperability with [Icinga Notifications](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga-notifications).
